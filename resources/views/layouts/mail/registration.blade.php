    <p> Hello {!! $name !!}, </p>
    <p>Welcome to Happily Health.<br/><br/>
        Holistic health is like a living and breathing organism and not just about our bodies. It is about the
        whole...‘the ability to adapt and to self-manage’ when facing physical, mental, and social challenges [Huber et
        al, 2011].<br/><br/>It is a resource and not just a state. A personal journey of gaining strength and making
        improvements.
        It is
        your individual journey (given your age, medical condition, lifestyle, social situation etc.) and about having
        the ability to to fulfill your unique potential and pursue a joyful life.<br/><br/>
        One needs to engage with their health day in and day out. Get to know it more intimately and not just when
        struck with a bout of illness or at the annual physical checkup, if at all. Have a positive relationship with it
        and not fear it. Know what works and what does not. Live with it. Work on it. Measure it. Improve it little by
        little.<br/><br/>So let’s stop being guilty of crash diets and warrior workouts just to look good for that
        december
        wedding, of
        fretting more and doing less, of smoking more and sleeping less, of surfing more and communicating less, of
        being boxed into packages only to unpack at a later date.<br/><br/>
        Let’s make health a lifelong joyful journey. Let’s Happily Health.
    <p><b>Regards</b><br/>Mansi<br/>Happily Health</p>
